# GSAS 2023 Workshop: Step 6

### Overview

OK, so what's next? To review:

1. We have deployed K8S, RabbitMQ, NATS and two services "welcome-svc" and "billing-svc"
2. We know that idempotence is important and we have implemented it in both services
3. We know that eventual consistency is easily achievable by just having a sane
messaging foundation

So what's next?

### What's next?

There are still a lot of things that _should_ be done for us to be able to 
sleep easy at night. Some things you might want to explore on your own time:

1. Observability is *extremely* important, especially when dealing with event
driven systems. Use an application performance monitoring solution, use debug
tools like [`streamdal`](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal) and
[`plumber`](https://github.com/streamdal/plumber).
2. Protect your services against DoS attacks - add a caching layer to (most)
network calls - and cache the response data in memory for 100ms + auto-reap old
cache data.
3. Learn about the saga pattern to deal with distributed transactions.
4. Implement a dead-letter strategy to deal with bad or incorrectly handled events.
5. Establish a common schema - the stricter, the better! Use protobuf!
6. Establish an event versioning strategy - diffing events is a pain - comparing
event version strings is _infinitely_ easier.
7. Make sure that your service shutdown behaves correctly, as in, it properly
stops consuming messages from the ISB and drains any in-flight messages.
8. Establish a standard service template - the more consistent your services are,
the faster your org will be able to move!
9. Establish _excellent_ monitoring for your global components - busses, K/V
stores, caches, etc. Your entire EDA architecture depends on these.
10. Load test your systems - due to the complexity of EDA, it is much harder to
identify potential bottlenecks by just looking at diagrams or code.

### Done

ðŸŽ‰ You have completed the workshop! ðŸŽ‰

The setup and "scenarios" in this workshop are not "theoretical" - I have 
personally worked with several, almost identical platforms and software 
architectures. This architecture can _easily_ scale to hundreds of services
and not have it all devolve into complete chaos.

Some last moment notes:

1. The above `welcome-svc` and `billing-svc` are both based on a Go code template
that our company has used to power ~30 services in production for the last two
years, maintained by a team of 3 backend engineers.
2. The services are usually handling on avg ~5,000 internal, protobuf encoded
events/s.
3. Event driven is not for everyone - but it is a common enough eventuality for 
companies that have exhausted traditional scaling techniques. This workshop
has aimed to prepare you for that scenario.
